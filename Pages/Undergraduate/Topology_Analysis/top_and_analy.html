				<h1>Topology and Analysis</h1>
				<p>Analysis is the area of mathematics concerned with formalising the foundations of calculus and related concepts,
				generalising them to more abstract settings. This builds upon the study of topology, where we consider spaces with
				key geometrical properties, ways to classify them, and features of these spaces that are preserved under certain
				transformations.<p>

								Continuity for Metric Spaces
							</h1>
							<p>
								Continuity stands at the heart of both topology and analysis, a starting point
								for our understanding of smooth transformations. For metric spaces, there are many
								equivalent characterisations of continuity, and each one comes with interesting 
								implications for us to explore.
