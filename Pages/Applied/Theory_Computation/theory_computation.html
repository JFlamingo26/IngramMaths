				<h1>Theory of Computation</h1>
				<p>One could argue that computer science was truly born from the study of formal languages
				and abstract machines known as automata. From this came key notions such as computability,
				complexity and classes of languages. Thus far no model of computation or calculation has
				been found to solve more problems than the Turing machine, allowing us to use these machines
				to get a grasp of the limitations of computers, algorithms and problems as we know them.<p>

								Reduction

							<p>
								Why do we know that it's possible to make jam on toast? Well, we know that it's
								possible to toast bread, to take out the jam, and to apply the jam to the toast.
								If we can do these things, then we can make jam on toast. This is, in effect, the
								concept of reduction: we make a problem feasible by reducing it to problems that are
								already known. The question is, how do we formalise this, and what can we use it for?
